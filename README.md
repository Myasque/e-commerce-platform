E-commerce trading platform design and implementation
This assignment consists of three topics that make the e-commerce trading platform progressively more functional. The first two topics are the stand-alone version, running as a single process. The third topic is the network version, which requires a CS structure with different processes on the client and server side. Note that to complete the requirements of the topic, it is recommended to have the overall design of the system first, and then go to the system in three phases to gradually implement the system, so as to avoid huge changes to the program at a later stage.

Topic 1: Account management subsystem and commodity management subsystem (stand-alone version)


Title II: transaction management subsystem (stand-alone version)


Title III: e-commerce trading platform (network version)
